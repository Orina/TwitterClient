# Project 3 - *Twitter Client*

**Twitter Client** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **28** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X]	User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [X]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [X] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [X] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
  * [X] User can view more tweets as they scroll with [infinite pagination](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView). Number of tweets is unlimited.
    However there are [Twitter Api Rate Limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) in place.
* [X] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [X] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  * [X] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  * [X] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page
* [X] User can **click a link within a tweet body** on tweet details view. The click will launch the web browser with relevant page opened.
* [X] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
* [X] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [X] Compose tweet functionality is build using modal overlay
* [X] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [X] [Leverage RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) as a replacement for the ListView and ArrayAdapter for all lists of tweets.
* [X] Move the "Compose" action to a [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Floating-Action-Buttons) instead of on the AppBar.
* [X] On the Twitter timeline, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to apply scrolling behavior that [hides / shows the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
* [X] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Implemented local SQLite database entries (Tweet, User) manually without ORM
* [X] Implemented a ContentProvider to access and update the data
* [X] Persist data in Repository with memory cache and local/remote data sources
* [X] Use custom Loader to load data from memory cache/local database. It extends AsyncTaskLoader.
* [X] Use HandlerThread to access/update data in local data source (SQLite database)
* [X] Implemented MVP pattern, where Presenter inits Loader and listen to its callback.
